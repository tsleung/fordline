"""Luck or skill? Reads the ROW lines tests/luck_skill.gd prints and reports
how much of a battle's outcome the commander decides and how much the draw
and the dice decide.

    python3 tests/luck_skill.py build/luck/*.txt

The outcome is the final resolve margin (player minus enemy, -100..100).
Its spread is split, battle by battle, the way a two-way analysis of
variance splits it:
    commander   - the four policies differ on average
    draw        - some maps and rosters are easier for everyone
    fit         - which commander does best depends on the map
    dice        - the same commander on the same map, different dice
Commander and fit are skill; draw and dice are luck.
